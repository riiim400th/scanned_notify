4. Test whether the recipient receives the email by using `Send Test Mail` .
5. Start the scan in Burp Suite. A completion email will be sent after the scan finishes.

## Note
A completion email will also be sent for scans not created by the user (e.g., scans triggered by other extensions or default passive crawling). To avoid unnecessary emails, turn on the "Scanned Notify" tab's Enable option only when needed.

Additionally, if an upstream proxy is configured, the email sending request to Gmail may pass through the proxy. Please ensure proper handling of this.
